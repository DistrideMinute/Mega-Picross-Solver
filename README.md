# Mega-Picross-Solver
I got bored playing picross, so for fun I made a solver for it. Heuristic brute force.


While travelling I was playing through 3DS games, I got bored of Pokemon Picross because of how algorithmically I was playing - so I thought 'Why not make a solver for fun?'.
As such it can solve certain puzzle elements unique to the game.
Due to the small problem space, heuristic brute force is partly used.
